				        <p>I am a final year Computer Games Design student, with a passion for games content that pushes boundaries, and cooking vast quantities of food. Having completed my year-long placement working in a UK VR games company I have developed what I believe to be an extensive range of skills in multiple areas. Within this team my role consists mainly of blueprinting within Unreal Engine, which suits me as I have a penchant for logic and foresight, combined with design-oriented thinking.  I thoroughly enjoy horror films and designing and developing VR content.</p>

				      <div class="description">
				        <p>I’m a final year Games Programming student and I’ve been playing games for as long as I remember, and they’ve always been an inspiration in my life. As I grew up, I realised that more and more people felt the same way about games that I did; they were passionate. This is the very reason that I am here today. The feeling that people get when they complete a game, that feeling of accomplishment and pride. I believe that everyone deserves to feel that way, and being a games programmer is the best thing I can do to help.</p>
